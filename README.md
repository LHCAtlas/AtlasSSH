# AtlasSSH
Commands to run Atlas software from a library via SSH to a Linux node

Introduction
============

The goals for version 1.0:

   * Send commands to a Linux node, get back the responses
   * Sufficient functionality to download a dataset from from the GRID
   * Be able to copy that dataset locally

There are, obviously, stretch goals. For everything, see the issues up on github.
